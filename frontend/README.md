# Run the frontend on dev mode

This mode gives rapid feedback on the browser to changes made on the Vue project.

First make sure the server is already running. One way to achieve this is as per the instructions in the [project README.md](../README.md).

Then run:

```txt
npm run serve
```

Open the dev server: http://localhost:8081/

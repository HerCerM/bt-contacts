# Run the frontend on dev mode

This mode gives rapid feedback on the browser to changes made on the Vue project.

On a terminal opened on the frontend module, run:

```txt
npm run serve
```

Then run the backend server. One way to achieve this is as per the instructions in the [project README.md](../README.md).

Finally open the dev server: http://localhost:8081/
